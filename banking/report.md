Dear Aryaman Suhas Sonawane,

Re: Notification of Missing/Pending Documents for Account Onboarding

We appreciate your interest in opening a new account with our institution. However, after reviewing your submitted documents, our verification team has identified a discrepancy that requires your attention.

Based on our KYC verification process, we found the following issues:

- The first name provided ("Aryaman") does not match the expected first name ("Aryaman Suhas") as per your official documents. The message from our verification team is: "The first name provided does not match the expected first name. Please ensure the full first name is provided as per the official documents."
- Your last name ("Sonawane"), address ("Yash Residency Row House NO.8,Pashan SUS Road"), and Aadhar number ("955061332922") have been successfully verified and match our expected records.

To proceed with the account onboarding, we require you to resubmit the first name document with your full name as it appears on your official documents. This is in line with our regulatory compliance requirements to ensure the accuracy and security of our customers' information.

The list of missing/pending documents is as follows:
1. Valid first name document reflecting your full first name as "Aryaman Suhas".

Once we receive the corrected document, we will expedite the verification process. If you have any questions or need assistance in resubmitting the required documents, please do not hesitate to contact us.

We appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and look forward to completing your account onboarding process soon.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
Banking Onboarding Agent
